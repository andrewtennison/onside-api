It is the first in the third\u2011tier between these sides since 1980, but, more pertinently, it is perhaps the first time since 1967-68, when both teams were battling against relegation from the First Division, that a league fixture between United and Wednesday has had greater meaning. Though both sides have bobbed between the divisions in the years since, and regularly locked horns while doing so, one has always been on the way up, one on the way down. This time around both are looking upwards, the Steel City shindigs forming subplots in a bigger promotion picture.<br \/><br \/>There is no doubt that the clubs \u2013 third (Wednesday) and seventh (United) after this result \u2013 are the big beasts of the division. Hillsborough was home to the second-highest League One attendance of the weekend, with more than 11,000 fans buying tickets for the beam-back of the game at Bramall Lane where 28,136 watched live. Both sides average just shy of 20,000, comfortably the highest gates in the division.<\/p><p>Despite those healthy attendances both sides have been keen to \"reprofile\" their playing staff, essentially boardroom doublespeak for cost-cutting. High earners have been encouraged to leave, their replacements bought from the budget aisles. Wednesday took Chris O'Grady from Rochdale, Chris Lines from Bristol Rovers, and Gary Madine from Carlisle and United look increasingly to their youngsters, runners-up in the FA Youth Cup last season.<\/p><p>Regardless of those constraints, the pressure is on both managers to deliver, and their respective histories add an extra layer of spice. United's Danny Wilson is a former Wednesday player and manager, his popularity in the blue half of Sheffield currently plummeting, while Megson (also a former Owls player) played a key part in the infamous Battle of Bramall Lane while at West Bromwich Albion and is now a pantomime villain in these parts of almost Warnockian proportions.<\/p><p>He will go on irritating the red half of the city with many more afternoons like this. Megson's side are the form team in the division, having bounced back from a 5-1 humiliation at Stevenage with four successive wins and now this result. \"Coming to Bramall Lane is a hard game for any team and for us it's the hardest game of the season,\" said Megson, whose side remain five points clear of their city rivals having played a game more. \"And having been 2-0 down with seven or eight minutes left the dressing room feels like it did after those four wins.\"<\/p><p>Derbies always start in a frenzy, and this was no exception,but the battles are more often in midfield than in front of goal. This, then, was something of a rarity \u2013 the frenzy was there, but chances followed in a flurry. After half an hour, the home side were two goals to the good and the visitors had twice hit the woodwork.<\/p><p>Stephen Quinn opened the scoring, sweeping home after Ched Evans's effort had hit the post. Eight minutes later Chris O'Grady was somehow denied by the combination of post and Steve Simonsen and seconds later Evans doubled United's lead with a near-post header.<\/p><p>Ben Marshall then saw his drive tipped onto the bar by Simonsen before fizzing shots gave way to thunderous tackles for much of the middle part of the game. The frazzle and fury only really returned when, with eight minutes to go, O'Grady nodded home after a spot of head tennis. Seconds later Simonsen missed his punch under pressure \u2013 \"The referee got the decision wrong. End of story,\" said a furious Wilson \u2013 and Madine headed in the equaliser. Those in the away end of course went home the happier at the result, but only  can either set of supporters truly slake their thirst for success.<\/p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/league-one-2011-12\">League One 2011-12<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/sheffieldunited\">Sheffield United<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/sheffieldwednesday\">Sheffield Wednesday<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/profile\/johnashdown\">John Ashdown<\/a><\/div><br\/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk<\/a> &copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The pair are now fourth and ninth after Saturday's results.<\/p><p>Wilson's Hillsborough heritage ensures he is still regarded with suspicion by some Blades fans. Yet at least the manager who had Barnsley fans chanting \"It's just like watching Brazil\" as his old team sweet-passed their way into the Premier League back in 1997 is not about to repeat the mistake of a famous Bramall Lane predecessor.<\/p><p>In January 2008 Bryan Robson, then in charge of United, prepared for a Steel City derby by suggesting the game merely represented \"just another three&nbsp;points\". It met with a similarly hostile reception to that which greeted Ruud Gullit when, a decade earlier, the then Newcastle manager claimed matches against Sunderland were \"nothing special\".<\/p><p>Happily, Wilson is not about to fall into the same trap. \"This derby's going to be something else,\" he says. \"The atmosphere will be superb, it's going to be incredibly intense. It's a chance for my lads to go down in the history of this football club.<\/p><p>\"I don't want any player to underestimate this derby or what it means to the fans, and we've got to be ready. I can safely say we're going to have to be prepared for a high-tempo game. It's going to be hammer and tongs out there.\"<\/p><p><\/p><p>While United boast the collective experience of Stephen Quinn, Nick Montgomery and the one-time Hillsborough striker Richard Cresswell, they are up against a Wednesday ensemble whose pragmatic style under Megson has not prevented them producing League One's most incisive predator in Gary Madine.<\/p><p>The 21-year-old striker's 10 goals in 12 league games have had Hillsborough reverberating to the strains of \"Gary&nbsp;Madine \u2013 Goal Machine\" while transporting him to the top of the division's scoring charts. His likely duel with United's immensely promising teenage central defender Harry Maguire promises to provide a fascinating&nbsp;subplot.<\/p><p>\"It's all down to me getting quality balls&nbsp;in the box,\" Madine claims, somewhat modestly, but Megson's direct&nbsp;approach is clearly doing his game&nbsp;no harm.<\/p><p>Neither,&nbsp;significantly, do the weekly squad running sessions \u2013 beloved by Wednesday's manager but decried by&nbsp;some coaches as hopelessly old-fashioned \u2013 seem to be&nbsp;damaging the promotion hopes of a&nbsp;team much improved&nbsp;by the installation of the 6ft&nbsp;7in former Scunthorpe centre-half Rob Jones, a boyhood Owls fan and now their captain.<\/p><p>Bolstered by Wednesday's best start to a campaign for 30 years, Megson points to the straightforward values that underpin the success. \"Winning,\" he says. \"It's all about winning. When I played here under Howard Wilkinson I remember Howard talking about enjoying games and I told him I found that a strange thing to try and do. Enjoyment comes only from winning.\"<\/p><p>On Sunday Wilson will, for once, fully agree.<\/p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/sheffieldunited\">Sheffield United<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/sheffieldwednesday\">Sheffield Wednesday<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/profile\/louisetaylor\">Louise Taylor<\/a><\/div><br\/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk<\/a> &copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They are all big ones for those whose passions are tied to them but this fixture has something a little extra. It is the first third-tier meeting between the sides since 1980 for a start but perhaps more importantly the clubs are promotion rivals this season \u2013 it could be argued that not since both sides were battling against relegation in 1967-68 have they been competing for the same goal in the league standings.<\/p><p>\"We're excited about it, it's a massive game and the city is buzzing \u2013 it can't come round quick enough,\" says United's former Wednesday forward Richard Cresswell, who is well aware of the game's place in the wider scheme of the season. \"Both teams are looking for one thing and that's promotion. It's a Steel City derby but the main thing is to get out of League One. Both clubs really should be at a higher level. That's the ultimate aim.\"<\/p><p>And Sunday's affair is given another shake of spice by the man in the home dugout. Danny Wilson played for the blue half of Sheffield in the derby in the early 1990s and managed the Owls between 1998 and 2000 but now he is in charge of the Blades. Wilson seems to have been unaffected in the buildup \u2013 \"The gaffer has been exactly the same and the preparation has been exactly the same,\" says Cresswell \u2013 but the reception he gets at Bramall Lane (from the home<em> <\/em>and away terraces) will be interesting.<\/p><p>Cresswell is a player who knows all about swapping sides, having played under Wilson at Hillsborough, and he is certainly anticipating a charged atmosphere. \"I get a bit of stick but I thrive on that,\" he says. \"I enjoy it, I enjoy the atmosphere \u2013 it's tense and after the game everyone has to go back to work. Hopefully they're on the end of the right result.\"<\/p><p>Wilson's arrival at Bramall Lane, ahead of around a dozen other candidates according to the chairman, Kevin McCabe, was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/2011\/may\/27\/danny-wilson-sheffield-united-protests\" title=\"\">greeted by protests<\/a> and at the time it did seem an oddly provocative appointment. Wilson admitted he faced an uphill battle \u2013 \"It's not going to be easy. We have to play a certain brand of football and win games to win the fans over but you have to do that anywhere\" \u2013 and in the early weeks of the season the fight seemed to be won. The Blades won five and drew one of their opening six and after hammering Bury 4-0 at the start of September they sat second in League One, kept off top spot only by goal difference.<\/p><p>The mood in S2 was bolstered further by the travails on the other side of the city. Ten days after United's win over the Shakers, Wednesday visited Stevenage's Lamex Stadium and slipped to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.footytube.com\/video\/stevenage-borough-sheffield-wednesday-sep13-90477\" title=\"\">humiliating 5-1 defeat<\/a>. Gary Megson described it as \"the worst I have felt as a manager\" and that some of his side's defending \"had to be seen to be believed\". It left the Owls wedged in mid-table and wondering exactly where their season was heading.<\/p><p>But the momentum in Sheffield has now swapped sides. Since that debacle Wednesday have been the best side in the division, winning four from four and surging up to second. United's unbeaten record, on the other hand, has given away to three defeats in four games and they now trail the Owls by five points, though having played a game less.<\/p><p>It means Wednesday head into Sunday's game as the form side. It's thanks in no small part to \"Goal Machine\" Gary Madine, whose nickname was in danger of becoming an ironic one until a recent spurt \u2013 10 goals in his past nine games \u2013 made him the highest scorer in the Football League this season.<\/p><p>At Bramall Lane the defensive uncertainties that dogged them throughout last season have returned, while the goals have dried up \u2013 United have failed to score in three of their last four league matches. It is a worrying trend before a crucial stretch of fixtures: five games in 13 days, three of them \u2013 Wednesday, Preston and MK Dons \u2013 against sides likely to be in the end of season play-offs.<\/p><p>\"We made a really good start and then went into the Huddersfield game and got caught a bit short with a couple of counterattacks, and ever since then we've faltered a bit really,\" says Cresswell. \"We had a good win at Rotherham in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy which has brought a bit of confidence back to the side and you're automatically up for this kind of game anyway.\"<\/p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/league-one-2011-12\">League One 2011-12<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/sheffieldunited\">Sheffield United<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/sheffieldwednesday\">Sheffield Wednesday<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/leagueonefootball\">League One<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/football-league\">Football League<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/profile\/johnashdown\">John Ashdown<\/a><\/div><br\/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk<\/a> &copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Sheffield FC 0-0 Hallam FC (Friendly, 1862)<\/h2><p>On Boxing Day 1860, the first-ever football match between two separate clubs took place at Sandygate Road, Crosspool, Sheffield, the hosts Hallam FC losing 2-0 to Sheffield FC in the pure driven snow. But that's enough of that \u2013 seismic events, schmeismic events \u2013 because just look what happened when the two teams met a couple of years later.<\/p><p>In 1862, the owners of Bramall Lane \u2013 then solely a cricket ground \u2013 were looking into ways of making some extra money during cricket's off season. They decided to give the new football craze a whirl, the sport having grown quickly in popularity in the city ever since the Sheffield FC duo Major Nathanial Creswick and William Prest worked out a code of conduct for the game and committed the Sheffield Rules to paper in 1858. To test the water, a charity match \u2013 the world's first \u2013 was arranged between Sheffield and Hallam, to raise funds for soldiers who had fought in the American civil war. Bramall Lane's owners had hoped the event would win the cricketing cognoscenti over to what had been seen as an \"undignified\" pastime. How do you think this panned out, then?<\/p><p>Just after half-time, Major Creswick \u2013 Sheffield's star man as well as the sport's rulemaker \u2013 won the ball off his Hallam counterpart William Waterfall. In doing so, he clattered Waterfall, who had been tugging on his shirt, upside the head. A journalist from the Sheffield Independent was on hand to record what happened next, his match report another world first. (The Sheffield Daily Telegraph had sent someone along to the game in 1860, it's true, but they didn't deign to describe the action, stating that \"it would be invidious to single out the play of any particular gentleman when all did well\".)<\/p><p>Anyway, back to 1862. \"All parties agreed that the hit was accidental. Waterfall, however, ran at the Major in the most irritable manner and struck him several times. He also threw off his waistcoat and began to show fight in earnest.\" The paper went on to report that Creswick \"preserved his temper admirably\" and \"did not return a single blow\". The Major's waistcoat remained resolutely around his midriff at all times.<\/p><p>This version of events was disputed by Hallam, who sent a strongly worded letter into the paper by way of response. \"In the early part of the game, Waterfall charged the Major, on which the Major threatened to strike him if he did so again. Later in the game, when all the players were waiting a decision of the umpires, the Major, very unfairly, took the ball from the hands of one of our players and commenced kicking it towards their goal. He was met by Waterfall who charged him and the Major struck Waterfall on the face, which Waterfall immediately returned.\"<\/p><p>Yet more new ground broken, then: football's first brouhaha. The final score, incidentally, was 0-0, a rum state of affairs considering the game had gone on for three hours. The exact thoughts of the Bramall Lane committee regarding the fixture's success were not recorded.<\/p><h2>2. Sheffield United 3\u20132 The Wednesday (FA Cup second round, 1925)<\/h2><p>By rights, this game should have been a complete waste of time. The night before Sheffield's two giants met in the second round of the FA Cup at Bramall Lane at the tail end of January 1925, the heavens opened. And failed to shut. Rain fell all night and then all the following morning, turning the pitch into a mudbath. \"The ground was practically under water,\" reported the Times, cheerfully adding that the rain \"let off for half an hour\" after the kick-off.<\/p><p>The inclement weather didn't stop 40,256 supporters turning up, and they were rewarded for their determination with a classic. Within the first minute, both teams had chances to score, United's Fred Tunstall setting up Billy Gillespie for a shot at one end, The Wednesday (they wouldn't add their city to their name for another four years) forcing a corner that was hastily cleared at the other. After five minutes, Wednesday's Jimmy Trotter broke away and converted calmly. Four minutes later, Trotter added a second, pouncing on a mistake by George Green, who failed to intercept Arthur Lowdell's pass.<\/p><p>United were, the Times noted, \"in an unenviable position. But they pulled themselves together. Instead of getting rattled and indulging in wild kicking, as many sides would have done in like circumstances, they quietly settled down to play really good football.\" Gillespie and Tunstall combined again, teeing up Harry Johnson to blaze just over. Tommy Sampy saw a low fizzer saved well by Jack Brown in the Wednesday goal. Tunstall and Gillespie linked up for a third time, the latter seeing his shot saved, the follow-up slammed home by Sampy. Soon after, Green had converted Dave Mercer's right-wing cross, and the two teams were level after 20 minutes.<\/p><p>Tunstall broke clear twice before half-time, but twice spurned the opportunity to put United ahead. That was finally achieved a minute after half-time \u2013 the restart having been delayed by bad light, the referee refusing to allow the players to leave the pitch \u2013 when Sampy scored a pearler after a long weaving run. Wednesday pushed forward but could not equalise; in fact it was United who came closest to scoring again, Gillespie hitting a post in the dying moments. The outcome was pretty much as expected \u2013 United were a mid-table First Division side, Wednesday struggling to keep their status in the Second \u2013 but it had been achieved in a surprisingly rollercoaster fashion, and both sides took credit from a fine game. \"United deserved their victory,\" reported the Guardian. \"They were the faster of two sides that gave an astonishing exhibition on a ground that was hardly fit for play.\" It was a highly significant win, too, for United went on to win the Cup, Tunstall scoring the only goal in the final against Cardiff City.<\/p><h2>3. Sheffield United 7\u20133 Sheffield Wednesday (Second Division, 1951)<\/h2><p>The most spectacular scoreline in the history of the Steel City derby. Wednesday had just been relegated from the First Division, coming straight back down after going up in 1950. (Albeit rather unluckily, fellow relegation scrabblers Chelsea winning their last four games of the season to pip them on goal average by 0.044 of a goal, doubly sickening as Wednesday had won their last game of the season against Everton 6-0.) They were looking to yo-yo back up again, but their neighbours United had designs on promotion too. In early September, ahead of the derby, both teams were a point behind the early pacesetters, Notts County.<\/p><p>United would claim top spot by the end of the day with an astounding victory at Bramall Lane. Wednesday took an early lead through Keith Thomas, but Derek Hawksworth and Harold Brook made it 2-1 to United at half-time. Fred Furniss had missed a penalty for United, who would momentarily regret his failure on the hour when Dennis Woodhead equalised. But then the sky fell in on Wednesday; within a few minutes, Alf Ringstead (twice), Hawksworth and Fred Smith had flashed the Blades into a 6-2 lead. Woodhead scored his second of the game, but Brook restored United's four-goal cushion before the close of play. It was, at the time, the standalone largest winning margin in a Sheffield derby.<\/p><p>Ahead of the return fixture at Hillsborough in January, 17-year-old United trainee Graham Shaw turned up at Bramall Lane in his kit and boots, preparing to play for the reserves. But there had been a miscommunication. Shaw had been selected to make his debut in the derby, and with less than an hour to kick-off, had to wing it across the city via tram. He made it just in time, running out in front of 65,327 good folk, finding himself part of a team that completed the double over Wednesday, United running out 3-1 winners.<\/p><p>A season's worth of bragging rights for United, then. Or was it? Not really, is the answer to that: despite two comprehensive victories against their neighbours, United could only look on jealously as Wednesday discovered a scoring sensation in the ill-fated Derek Dooley \u2013 who at one point scored 22 goals in an astonishing nine-game burst \u2013 and won the Second Division title that year, achieving their goal of promotion with a goal tally of 100 goals, their new star striker having rattled 47 in all competitions. United meanwhile languished in mid-table, despite having knocked in a second-best divisional total of 90.<\/p><h2>4. Sheffield Wednesday 4\u20130 Sheffield United (Third Division, 1979)<\/h2><p>Wednesday were not favourites to win this match. They had been faffing around in the Third Division since 1975, a league they had only ever looked like leaving in the wrong direction. Jack Charlton had taken over in 1977, but progress was slow to nonexistent. Meanwhile United had slipped into the third tier for the first time in their history in 1979, but were favourites to win instant promotion. At Christmas, it looked on for the Blades: United were top of the table having won 14 of their 23 games, while Wednesday \u2013 who had started the season slowly \u2013 were back in sixth.<\/p><p>United were due at Hillsborough on Boxing Day morning, and expected to take a point from their stuttering neighbours, and maybe even eke out a win. It was not to be, as Wednesday came flying out of the traps, a lubricated Hillsborough wind in their sails. Ian Mellor cut inside from the left and lashed home the opener on 36 minutes, then in the second half Wednesday really took it up a gear: cult hero Terry Curran \u2013 a mustachioed striker-cum-winger who thought nothing of trading haymakers with Big Jack in training \u2013 added the second with a diving header before setting up the third for Jeff King, then winning a penalty which was converted by Mark Smith. Wednesday had equalled United's margin of victory in that storming rout of 1951, though United could at least claim that the pendulum had crunched them in the swingers \u2013 with the score at 1-0, their captain, Mick Speight, had been carted off with broken ribs.<\/p><p>But unlike Wednesday back in 51-52, United would gain no solace at the end of the 79-80 season. Galvanised by the Boxing Day Massacre, as the 4-0 quickly became known, Wednesday climbed the table, eventually claiming the third and last promotion spot. Along the way they secured a 1-1 draw at Bramall Lane, Curran scoring the goal of the season, sashaying from the corner flag on the left to the edge of the area before unleashing an unstoppable effort into the top right. United, however, fell from grace, winning only four more games all season, ending up in mid-table. Momentum had been truly lost: at the end of the following season, they dropped into the Fourth Division for the first time in their history.<\/p><h2>5. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Pxi29o_ceZc\" title=\"\">Sheffield United 2\u20130 Sheffield Wednesday<\/a> (First Division, 1991)<\/h2><p>With Wednesday spending most of the 80s in the top tier, and United scrabbling around the lower reaches of English football, there would be no league derbies in Sheffield between 1980 and 1991. Even when United made it back to the big time in 1990, after a 14-year absence, a decent enough Wednesday side somehow managed to get themselves relegated. It was the longest spell between Steel City league fixtures: if you take out the world wars, the next largest gap had been five years. So when Wednesday got their act together, and the two teams finally met again in the First Division in November 1991, the game was an understandably huge event. (In addition to the 11-year wait, it was also the first time the two sides had met in the top flight since 1968.)<\/p><p>United, managed by Dave Bassett, were in a bit of a pickle: they had just sold Tony Agana to relegation rivals Notts County, and were bottom of the league. Freshly promoted Wednesday \u2013 who had won the League Cup earlier in the year as a Second Division team \u2013 were, on the other hand, flying, fourth in the league, all the momentum with them. But momentum has, as we've seen, counted for little in Sheffield derbies. And so it was that United fan Dane Whitehouse capitalised on a Keystone Kops moment between Paul Warhurst and John Sheridan to put his side ahead, before Brian Deane sealed the deal by slotting home through England goalkeeper Chris Woods's legs. United went on to complete the double at Hillsborough, ending the season in ninth-placed comfort. The six points Wednesday shed against their neighbours cost them second place, incidentally; finishing in third, they only trailed second-placed Manchester United by three points, and eventual champions Leeds by seven.<\/p><h2>6. Sheffield Wednesday 2\u20131 Sheffield United (FA Cup semi-final, 1993)<\/h2><p>The most famous Steel City derby of all time. The FA, in their finite wisdom, had opted to stage the all-London semi between Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley, while ordering the two Sheffield teams to meet at Elland Road. On the face of it, logical enough, but it didn't factor in a supposed advantage for the two north London rivals, who would be getting a test run ahead of the final on the lush Wembley turf. Noises were made, protests were staged, petitions were signed, and finally the FA relented, allowing the city of Sheffield a day out at the home of English football.<\/p><p>The fans mingled for a very pleasant carnival atmosphere. \"From 7am on the Wembley concourse United and Wednesday fans greeted one another with the passion and surprise of long-lost relatives,\" relayed this paper. But the game was a slight anticlimax, the most comprehensive 2-1 win after extra time you'll ever see. Chris Waddle gave Wednesday the early lead after 62 seconds with a free-kick described by the Guardian as \"pulverising\"; the player of the year then proceeded to boss the play. Wednesday couldn't add a second, though, and it was Waddle who played ramblin' man Alan Cork onside for an unlikely equaliser just before half-time. United held on through 90 minutes, but were hoist with their own petard in extra time, Mark Bright scoring the winner with a Bassettesque set-piece header.<\/p><p>Wednesday fans often argue that their team \"should have won 10-1\" \u2013 they made a similar argument, incidentally, in perhaps the only other significant Sheffield derby since that cup semi. In January 2008, Wednesday beat United 2-0 at Hillsborough, their fans leaving the ground parping \"we should have won 10-0\". United were so poor it effectively spelt the end of Bryan Robson's dismal managerial reign. It also signalled the end of a period of United dominance in the fixture; the following year, Wednesday would complete their first double over United for 95 years.<\/p><p>Ninety-five years!<\/p><p><em>Many thanks to John Ashdown, John Garrett and Trevor Braithwait for their invaluable help<\/em><\/p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/sheffieldunited\">Sheffield United<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/sheffieldwednesday\">Sheffield Wednesday<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/profile\/scottmurray\">Scott Murray<\/a><\/div><br\/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk<\/a> &copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The 32-year-old, who created the opening goal in what was almost certainly his final action for the club, has agreed a three-year contract with Sydney FC.<\/p><p>\"He has young children and this is something of a family decision,\" said the manager Steve Kean. This, however, was a night about Blackburn's future rather than a man who is soon to become part of its past. Perhaps because Venky's crave a someone to convince audiences in Mumbai or Delhi that its ownership of Blackburn is a serious business, Kean's transfer headlines have revolved around patently unsuitable names like Ronaldinho and Raul.<\/p><p>Here, however, was a contest settled by two young forwards whose arrival would not have caused much of a ripple in Accrington, let alone Agra \u2013 products of Barcelona's La Masia academy and Dundee United's school of hard knocks. Between them, Rub\u00e9n Rochina and David Goodwillie knocked Sheffield Wednesday out cold before the travelling Yorkshire support had unfurled their banners.<\/p><p>The game was three minutes old when Emerton, thundering down the right flank, delivered the cross that Rochina anticipated before his marker and  volleyed home emphatically. Less than a minute later, he took a pass from Goodwillie, briefly lost his balance, and then shot hard and with remarkable precision into the corner of Richard O'Donnell's net.<\/p><p>Kean was probably taking a risk with Goodwillie when he brought him down from Tayside \u2013 and it was as much in terms of his off-the-field behaviour as the \u00a32.8m paid to Dundee United. The early signs are encouraging and in the seventh minute  Rochina provided the assist and, just for variation, Goodwillie placed it in the other corner of O'Donnell's net.<\/p><p>There was a sliver of hope for Wednesday when Clinton Morrison drove home in the second half but these sides have met three times in the League Cup in recent seasons and on each occasion they have found themselves in a lower division. Gary Megson bizarrely called this \"a magnificent night to be a Sheffield Wednesday manager\". He was referring to the passion of the Yorkshire support rather than the quality of the football they watched.<\/p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/carling-cup-2011-12\">Carling Cup 2011-12<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/carlingcup\">Carling Cup<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/blackburn\">Blackburn Rovers<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/sheffieldwednesday\">Sheffield Wednesday<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/profile\/tim-rich\">Tim Rich<\/a><\/div><br\/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk<\/a> &copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Danny Wilson and Gary Megson are the men charged with finding the escape route<\/p><p>Danny Wilson greets inquiries about his new life at Bramall Lane with a stock, deadpan, reply. \"I haven't had my nose broken yet \u2013 so that's a start,\" says Sheffield United's manager. Considering United rank among the League One promotion favourites and Wilson is the man who, back in 1997, famously had Barnsley fans singing \"It's just like watching Brazil\" as he steered their swashbuckling team into the Premier League, it seems an extraordinarily downbeat response.<\/p><p>Wilson, though, has history in Sheffield \u2013 as a player and later manager at Wednesday. In certain red-and-white-tinged and generally southern and western areas of the city the antipathy towards him remains almost as visceral as the day, late in May, when his arrival at Bramall Lane was greeted by vociferous carpark protests.<\/p><p>Anyone who expected the 51-year-old to receive more genteel treatment has clearly not read the following passage from Roy Hattersley's brilliant book Goodbye to Yorkshire. \"As a boy I genuinely believed in the man who never ate bacon because its red and white stripes reminded him of Sheffield United,\" wrote the retired Labour politician. \"Indeed in my blue and white Wednesday heart I applauded and supported his loyalty.\"<\/p><p>Loyalties of both persuasions remain intensely tribal in Steel City but have latterly been severely strained. Last season, United exited the Championship while, after dallying with administration, Wednesday struggled horribly in League One. It is 31 years since the famous old pair last both, ignominously, occupied English football's third tier. Then, as now, Sheffield derbies represented the only consolation. Not that either of this season's encounters are likely to match the so-called \"Boxing Day Massacre\" in 1979 when a 49,309 crowd at Hillsborough \u2013 still a record for this rung of the domestic game's ladder \u2013 watched Wednesday prevail 4-0.<\/p><p>With Milan Mandaric's boardroom takeover having secured the Owls' financial future, Hillsborough regulars are now hoping Gary Megson will prove the right manager to restore similarly rude on-field health. As a former Wednesday player and lifelong fan, no one doubts Megson's devotion to the cause but some supporters fear the 52-year-old may be too \"old school\". At a time when many other managers have long since abandoned regular, lengthy running sessions in favour of shorter sharper workouts, the Ginger Mourinho's players are still expected to cover the hard yards.<\/p><p>\"There are lots of things that are seen as old-fashioned but they work,\" says Megson. \"Once pre-season finishes the fitness work won't end. The players will run once a week. Some clubs don't do that now and I hear people questioning why footballers need to run but I firmly believe in it. You've got to be as good at running as you can.\"<\/p><p>United's attempts at global expansion have been, at least partly, blamed for the team's decline. In 2006 Kevin McCabe, the club's PLC chairman, acquired the Chinese team Chengdu Wuniu, renaming it Chengdu Blades as he strove to establish a commercial foothold in Asia.  Hungary's Ferencvaros was also purchased and links were established with Belgium's White Star Woluwe, Australia's Central Coast Mariners and Brazil's S\u00e3o Paulo, the aim being to share and jointly develop young players. Unfortunately such international ventures coincided with a downturn in the fortunes of the core business culminating in last spring's plunge into League One.<\/p><p>Suddenly the accent is very much back on parochial issues, most notably the peculiar passions provoked by Wilson's installation. \"I just have to get through it,\" he says. \"We decided it would be a good idea if I attended a few supporters' meetings in pubs and talked to them. Not to justify my position but to get them to understand.\"<\/p><p>At least he has inherited some talented young players, several of whom reached the final of last season's FA Youth Cup in which, despite losing to Manchester United, they impressed greatly, with Jordan Slew and Harry Maguire, already first-team regulars, catching the eye.<\/p><p>Big on entertainment \u2013 which is where his football philosophy clashes with Megson's \u2013 Wilson has ordered players to \"express themselves\" and \"not be afraid to try things\" as he endeavours to banish the Blades' lingering \"long ball\" image while succeeding in style.<\/p><p>\"I've always believed you can play good attacking football, proper football, and do well,\" he says. \"This club should really be in the Premier League so I want \u2013 and expect \u2013 to win promotion back to the Championship this season. I'm not bothered where Sheffield Wednesday finish \u2013 but if they're second and we're first I'll settle for that.\"<\/p><p>Although Megson has spoken darkly of \"attitudes having to change\" and \"standards needing to move upwards\" in the Hillsborough dressing room this summer, an expansion of his still small squad is likely to be bankrolled by Mandaric. Already Wednesday boast an excellent goalkeeper in Nicky Weaver and can only be strengthened by, among other recruits, signing the former Nottingham Forest left-back Julian Bennett and midfielder David Prutton.<\/p><p>Significantly, Imre Varadi, who has played as a striker for both clubs, believes Megson's task is the easier. \"Danny has definitely got the toughest job of the two,\" says Varadi. \"Blades fans will only forget Danny's past if he hits the ground running.

Unlike the Championship and League Two, no side seem to have financial clout that sets them apart, no relegated club should be expected to dominate, while the promoted teams are likely to look for consolidation rather than a sprint through the divisions.<\/p><p>It could be a year, then, for one of the division's stalwarts. In the past seven years, Huddersfield Town have only once finished outside the top 10 in the third tier and last season they were so clearly the third best team in the division that their defeat in the play-off final was the sort of result that has some calling for the scrapping of the post-season period and a return to three automatic promotion spots. Seven miserable minutes against Peterborough United wrecked the season. Some of Town's talent has gone \u2013 Lee Peltier to Leicester City and Anthony Pilkington to Norwich City\u2013 but manager Lee Clark's recruitment has been strong and sensible. It could, maybe even should, be their year.<\/p><p>Charlton Athletic do not qualify for stalwart status yet but the Addicks are getting there. This will be the club's third season at this level but they look well-equipped to make it their last. Athletic have flexed a little financial muscle and taken Dale Stephens from Oldham Athletic, Danny Green from Dagenham and Redbridge, Matt Taylor from Exeter City and the Bournemouth pair of Danny Hollands and Rhoys Wiggins \u2013 all key players for their previous sides. If Chris Powell can gel his squad then a promotion push is likely.<\/p><p>The Sheffield sides, together in the third tier for the first time since 1979-80, are arguably the big beasts of the division, but neither team are in great shape. Wednesday won only six games after mid-December (although the bulk of those came as things began to click under Gary Megson in April and May), while United's post-relegation fire sale has not yet got enough high earners off the books at Bramall Lane. Both will do well to make the play-offs.<\/p><p>Preston North End, United's fellow relegatees, are in a similar boat and lost the influential Keith Treacy to Burnley this week, while Scunthorpe United may also need a season of rebuilding under Alan Knill. The League Two champions, Chesterfield, lost top scorer Craig Davies over the summer and will be satisfied if they steer clear of relegation, Wycombe  Wanderers likewise having failed to establish themselves following their last promotion campaign in 2008-09. Stevenage and Bury are on similar ground, though, for all the promoted sides, the importance of momentum should not be understated.<\/p><p>League One is ripe for a shock, then, and of the other contenders Brentford and Leyton Orient may well be the likeliest lads. Niall McGinn and last season's League Two top scorer Clayton Donaldson are interesting additions at Griffin Park (although Uwe R\u00f6sler remains an unknown quantity in the dugout), while the Orient, who missed out on the play-offs by a point last year, have kept their squad together and their manager Russell Slade out of the clutches of others.<\/p><h2>Predictions<\/h2><p><strong>Champions<\/strong> Huddersfield<\/p><p><strong>Promoted<\/strong> Charlton<\/p><p><strong>Play-offs<\/strong> MK Dons, Brentford, Preston, one of the Sheffield sides<\/p><p><strong>Top half<\/strong> One of the Sheffield sides, Leyton Orient, Scunthorpe, Exeter, Chesterfield, Rochdale<\/p><p><strong>Bottom half<\/strong> Bournemouth, Colchester, Carlisle, Wycombe, Walsall, Hartlepool, Tranmere, Yeovil<\/p><p><strong>Relegated<\/strong> Stevenage, Bury, Oldham, Notts County<\/p><div class=\"related\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/leagueonefootball\">League One<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/bournemouth\">Bournemouth<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/brentford\">Brentford<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/bury\">Bury<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/carlisle\">Carlisle<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/charltonathletic\">Charlton Athletic<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/chesterfield\">Chesterfield<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/colchester\">Colchester<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/exetercityfc\">Exeter City<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/hartlepool\">Hartlepool<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/huddersfield\">Huddersfield<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/leytonorient\">Leyton Orient<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/mkdons\">MK Dons<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/nottscounty\">Notts County<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/oldham\">Oldham<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/preston\">Preston North End<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/rochdale\">Rochdale<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/scunthorpe\">Scunthorpe<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/sheffieldunited\">Sheffield United<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/sheffieldwednesday\">Sheffield Wednesday<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/stevenage\">Stevenage<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/tranmere\">Tranmere<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/walsall\">Walsall<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/wycombe\">Wycombe<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/yeoviltown\">Yeovil Town<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/league-one-2011-12\">League One 2011-12<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class=\"author\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/profile\/johnashdown\">John Ashdown<\/a><\/div><br\/><div class=\"terms\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\">guardian.co.uk<\/a> &copy; 2011 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Fans of erratic unpredictability will be delighted that the Italian has decided to undertake his first managerial role at a club that has just been relegated from League One (having finished bottom of the division) and with which he shares no previous ties. What could possibly go wrong?<br \/><br \/>\"I'm sure about my knowledge, I'm sure about my understanding of football,\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/2011\/may\/24\/paolo-di-canio-swindon-town-manager\" title=\"said Di Canio shortly his appointment at the County Ground\">said Di Canio shortly after his appointment at the County Ground<\/a> last month, before then claiming to have provisionally struck up a deal with Milan which will see \"young, talented players\" move from the Italian champions to Swindon on an initial loan basis.<\/p><p>It is highly unlikely that will actually happen and Di Canio probably knows that. Yet the claim only fuels the belief that the 42-year-old's time at the club will be memorable if not necessarily long and meaningful.<\/p><p>Also changing their manager following relegation have been <strong>Sheffield United<\/strong>, but unlike at Swindon the appointment there has drawn more fury that fanfare, with Blades fans reacting to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/2011\/may\/27\/danny-wilson-sheffield-united-protests\" title=\"the arrival of Danny Wilson with street protests and a banner that read Love United, Hate Wilson\">the arrival of Danny Wilson with street protests and a banner that read \"Love United, Hate Wilson\"<\/a>.<\/p><p>Having seen their club relegated to the third tier for the first time since 1989, the last thing United supporters wanted was for a former Sheffield Wednesday midfielder and manager to take over at Bramall Lane, but that is what they got.<\/p><p>\"I feel privileged to have become the manager of Sheffield United and I want to bring success to the club as soon as possible,\" said the 51-year-old in an attempt to mollify the hatred of the home faithful which was aroused by his move \u2013 and which no doubt has also stoked animosity among those who used to cheer him at Hillsborough. As such, next season's revival of the Sheffield derby should be well worth tuning in for.<\/p><p>Wilson's arrival at United followed Micky Adams's departure from the club and he too will be a source of talking points next season having recently returned to <strong>Port Vale<\/strong>. The team were pushing hard for automatic promotion from League Two until the 49-year-old left last December to take over at Bramall Lane. Under his replacement, Jim Gannon, Vale finished 11th, three points off the play-offs, and so the return of Adams is a case of unfinished business, with supporters hoping he has not been scarred by his disastrous tenure in Sheffield.<\/p><p>Adams insists he is ready to pick up from where he left off and, indeed, is so invigorated by his return to Vale Park that on Monday he announced <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk\/vale\/portvalenews\/Port-Vale-Supporters-hit-Adams-board-announcement\/article-3629697-detail\/article.html\" title=\"his intention to become a director at the club\">his intention to become a director at the club<\/a> following an extraordinary general meeting last week where some of the board of directors were unseated.<\/p><p>\"I am waiting to extend contracts for existing players and to sign new players, and this can't take place until the minimum number of directors is in office,\" said Adams.<\/p><p>In the Championship, there will be much interest in how <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/2011\/jun\/01\/barnsley-rochdale-keith-hill-manager\" title=\"Keith Hill does at Barnsley\">Keith Hill does at <strong>Barnsley<\/strong><\/a> after the surprise <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/2011\/may\/15\/mark-robins-barnsley-resigns\" title=\"departure of Mark Robins following a disagreement with the board over funds for new players\">departure of Mark Robins following a disagreement with the board over funds for new players<\/a>. Hill led Rochdale to their first promotion since 1969 when he got the club into League One last April and at Oakwell they will hope he can take a team that finished 17th last season, Barnsley's highest finish for five years, to greater heights.<\/p><p>The division's highest-profile appointment so far, however, is that of Sam Allardyce at <strong>West Ham<\/strong>. A club reeling from relegation and the impending loss of stellar performers, most notably Scott Parker, have reacted with uncharacteristic shrewdness. But with that comes pressure. Allardcye will be expected to lead West Ham to promotion, even the league title, and anything less will only fuel a sense of great underachievement. Add to that a supposed clash of styles, with \"The Academy\" having been taken over by a man whose only apparent path forward is route one, and Upton Park's home dugout will be worth keeping an eye in the months ahead.<\/p><p>Next on intrigue's hit list is <strong>Cardiff<\/strong>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/2011\/may\/30\/craig-bellamy-favourite-cardiff-city-manager\" title=\"with Craig Bellamy among those tipped\">with Craig Bellamy among those tipped<\/a> to replace <a href=\"http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/football\/2011\/may\/30\/dave-jones-cardiff-city-sacked\" title=\"the recently sacked Dave Jone\">the recently sacked Dave Jone<\/a>s as manager.

Brendan Rogers has undoubtedly done superb work with Swansea. Dougie Freedman hasn't had the credit he deserves for dragging Crystal Palace out of the bottom three. But in keeping Millwall within grabbing distance of the play-offs until the final weeks of the season on a budget not so much shoe-string as cheese-wire, <strong>Kenny Jackett<\/strong> deserves immense credit. In three full seasons at the Den, Jackett has guided the Lions to two play-off finals, promotion and now the club's highest league position since 2002-03, despite his most expensive purchase being the half a million or so spent on Josh McQuoid in January. I wasn't alone in tipping Millwall to struggle at the start of the season, yet they have confounded expectations and for that Jackett deserves as much credit as Lambert and co.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>League One<\/strong><\/p><p>While we must doff our collective caps to Leyton Orient's Russell Slade, Exeter City's Paul Tisdale, and particularly Rochdale's Keith Hill, it can't be easy to manage in the middle of a contradiction. \"We are going be run the fourth or fifth biggest wage budget in the division,\" said the MK Dons chairman Peter Winkelman at the start of the season. \"If you just go on money alone that's enough to be in the play-off spots.\" Yet it was surely a sign of the shaky confidence at stadium:mk that <strong>Karl Robinson<\/strong>'s initial contract as manager was, according to the local press, thought to run out on May 10 \u2013 five days before the play-offs begin. The youngest manager in league football has coped admirably with the burden of expectation and finally signed a new three-year deal last month. Roberto di Matteo guided Milton Keynes to third in 2008-09, but he could hit the ground running, building on Paul Ince's League Two title-winning side. Robinson has not had that luxury, taking over an Ince side that finished 12th last year, won their final game of the season on 9 March, and reeling from the Guv'nor's decision to walk because \"I don't feel it will be possible to take the team forward\". Huddersfield deserve to, and probably will, go up through the play-offs but don't be surprised if they have to beat Robinson's side to do it.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>League Two <\/strong><\/p><p>It's only 11 years since Accrington Stanley were in the Unibond Division One, the seventh tier of English football. It's only 18 months since Accrington Stanley nearly went out of business. It's only 12 weeks since they were 19th in League Two, a mere five points clear of the relegation zone. Now they're only three games from League One. <strong>John Coleman <\/strong>has done an astonishing job with Stanley, though that's nothing new. This is the 12th successive year of season-on-season improvement at the club. How long since Coleman took over? 12 years. The antithesis of the hire 'em fire 'em approach at plenty of clubs has seen Stanley finish 20th, then 17th, then 16th, then 15th and now fifth since their return to the Football League. They've got the second smallest average attendance in the Football League \u2013 1,868 (10 teams in the Blue Square Premier can boast bigger gates) \u2013 but since mid-February Coleman's side have been the best in the division. Paul Buckle has done fine work at Torquay, Giuliano Grazioli has rewritten his name in Barnet folklore, and John Sheridan has finally succeeded in taking Chesterfield back up, but Coleman's achievement takes some beating.<\/p><p><\/p><h2>Player of the year<\/h2><p><\/p><p><strong>Championship<\/strong><\/p><p>Adel Taarabt's twinkle toes may have stolen the headlines, and the Championship's official player of the year award, but the Moroccan hasn't even been the most important player in the QPR side, never mind the whole division. That honour goes to <strong>Paddy Kenny<\/strong>, whose performances have earned his side more points than any other player. Two wonderful saves against Leicester before Ishmael Miller scored the only goal of the game. A cracking double save at 1-1 against Coventry, a match that Rangers went on to win 2-1. A fine block at Swansea in December with the scores at 1-0, another in the 1-0 win at Reading to deny Simon Church at 0-0. A quite brilliant stop, the finest individual action I've witnessed this season, to deny Derby's Stephen Pearson in the 0-0 last month. In total the former Republic of Ireland international kept 24 clean sheets \u2013 a club record and comfortably the most in the division (the excellent Dorus de Vries at Swansea is second on the list with 21, having played a couple more games). Kenny has been the foundation for QPR's firepower \u2013 and he quite rightly picked up both the Players' Player and Supporters' Player of the Year Awards at Loftus Road.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>League One<\/strong><\/p><p>Craggy-faced, iron-jawed, really-wouldn't-want-to-spill-his-pint defenders rarely get enough credit. Take the shortlist for the official League One player of the year \u2013 Craig Mackail-Smith, Glenn Murray and Bradley Wright-Phillips. No one could deny their importance to their respective teams' campaigns but Gordon Greer, Kevin Langmead and Jose Fonte (although the latter hardly falls into the craggy category) deserve their share of the limelight. Perhaps the craggiest of all is Huddersfield's <strong>Peter Clarke<\/strong>. The Terriers' stunning form since the turn of the year has been based on the solidity of their defensive unit, and Clarke has been the leader. And he's apparently <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kickette.com\/the-tuesday-torso-peter-clarke-huddersfield-town\/\" title=\"\">appealing in other ways too<\/a>.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>League Two<\/strong><\/p><p>It's been a funny old career for <strong>Clayton Donaldson<\/strong>. Jettisoned by Bradford as a youngster, he rebuilt his career in the non-league with York, making appearances for the England National XI side, before heading to Hibs. That big move didn't quite work out and he joined Crewe back in 2008. Nineteen goals in 74 league matches as Alexandra tumbled out of League One and struggled in League Two hardly boded well for another renaissance but this season he has been sensational, the difference between mid-table and another season of struggle. His 28 goals in the league, nine of them in a seven-game flurry at the end of the season, has the vultures from higher echelons are circling. Crewe need his goals, but may not be able to hold on to the out of contract 27-year-old. Or maybe they will. \"As far as I know, I won't be able to match his wages, but I'm led to believe that's not quite the case,\" said a slightly confusing Dario Gradi last week.<\/p><p><\/p><h2>Signing of the year<\/h2><p><\/p><p><strong>Championship<\/strong><\/p><p>I'm sure I wasn't the only one raised an eyebrow when late in the August transfer window Reading spent \u00a3150,000 on 33-year-old <strong>Ian Harte<\/strong>.  After shining success with Leeds he had spells with Levante, Sunderland and Blackpool, and seemed to have found his level with Carlisle, ready to see out his career in League One, thumping in the odd free-kick and battling fading pace with increasing nous. Instead, he has been a crucial cog in the Royals play-off push. Since displacing summer signing Marcus Williams and making the left-back slot his own only Jobi McAnuff and Shane Long have played more minutes this season. And with 11 goals he's been comfortably the top-scoring defender in the league, a good-old goalscoring throwback of a full-back.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>League One <\/strong><\/p><p>Back in the summer <strong>Liam Bridcutt<\/strong>'s footballing future was far from certain. The midfielder had struggled to find a deal following his release by Chelsea. A trial at Wycombe came to nothing and a few weeks training with Crystal Palace was equally fruitless, so it was back to the Blues simply to keep fit. Three weeks later Gus Poyet and Brighton took a punt and have been richly rewarded. An initial five-month contract became a deal until the end of the season and last month the 21-year-old signed up for another two years. Tenacious and skillful, Bridcutt is likely to play a major role in what will probably be another strong promotion push next season.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>League Two<\/strong><\/p><p>When a player has notched up nine clubs by the age of 24, it's fair for fans of the 10th to have low expectations. And it's fair to say that <strong>Craig Davies'<\/strong>s<strong> <\/strong>career trajectory had been moving in one direction for a while.  Four caps for Wales before his 21st birthday suggested an exciting future, but things began to go wrong after his brave decision to join Hellas Verona from Oxford. Homesickness led to a loan move to Wolves after only eight months in Italy, then a permanent move to Oldham. Unspectacular spells at Stockport, Brighton, Yeovil and Port Vale all came and went before the now 24-year-old Davies joined Chesterfield on a free last summer. His impact has been remarkable. A superb spell of 12 goals in 14 games between August and November \u2013 a run that included winners against Lincoln and Northampton and a brace in a 2-1 victory at Wycombe \u2013 fired Chesterfield to the League Two summit. Neither the Spireites or Davies have looked back since.<\/p><p><\/p><h2>Flops of the year<\/h2><p><\/p><p><strong>Championship <\/strong><\/p><p>\"Kevin Blackwell has problems at full-back, but should at least have a settled side this year after the revolving door season of 2009-10,\" I wrote on these pages back in August. But instead of shutting the revolving door, <strong>Sheffield United <\/strong>opened another one.

Inconsistency has been a huge problem \u2013 an eight-goal swing saw them beat Bristol Rovers one weekend and lose 5-1 at Exeter the next \u2013 though it's worth bearing in mind that the last time Wednesday were this bad (when they finished 16th in League One in 2004-05) they were promoted the following year.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>League Two<\/strong><\/p><p>Completing a pretty miserable season in Yorkshire, Leeds United apart, <strong>Bradford City<\/strong> were the bookies' favourites at the start of the season (though they probably shouldn't have been) and expectations at Valley Parade were high \u2013 the opening league win of the season, 1-0 against Stevenage, was greeted by boos from some sections of the home crowd.
